# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the installation process for the "Web Translate Script." The entire process is simple and can be completed in just two steps.

## Step 1: Install a User Script Manager

To run this script, you first need to install a "User Script Manager" extension in your browser. This is a browser add-on that allows you to install and manage third-party scripts that enhance web pages.

We highly recommend **[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)**, as it is the most popular and powerful script manager available.

Please visit its official website to download and install it for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="display: inline-block; padding: 10px 20px; background-color: #42b983; color: white; border-radius: 8px; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
    Go to Tampermonkey Website
  </a>
</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For users of `Chrome / Chromium`-based browsers, please ensure you enable "Developer mode" on the extensions management page (`chrome://extensions`) after installation for the best compatibility.

## Step 2: Install the Web Translate Script

Once Tampermonkey is installed, you can install our translation script.

We recommend installing the **CDN version**, as it has a smaller script size and automatically receives the latest translation updates without any manual intervention.

1.  **Click the installation link below.**
2.  Tampermonkey will automatically capture this link and open a new page showing the script's source code and information.
3.  On that page, **click the "Install" button.**

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qing90bing/Qing_Web-Translate-Script/main/dist/Web-Translate-Script.cdn.user.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="display: inline-block; padding: 10px 20px; background-color: #3eaf7c; color: white; border-radius: 8px; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
    Click to Install (CDN Version)
  </a>
</div>

After installation, the script is ready to go!

## Step 3: Verify the Installation

After a successful installation, you can visit any supported website (e.g., [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)), and the script will automatically detect and apply the translation.

You can also click the Tampermonkey icon in your browser's toolbar and see that the "Web Translate Script" is enabled in the dashboard.

Now, you can start enjoying a cleaner, more user-friendly browsing experience!
