# Introduction

## 🤔 What is this?

The "Web Translate Script" is a browser script based on [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

It differs from the browser's built-in "full-page translation" feature. The translations in this script are primarily contributed and proofread by the community, aiming to provide translations that better suit the reading habits of Chinese users for certain websites.

This project hopes to:

- Improve the browsing experience on some frequently used websites
- Lower the barrier to reading foreign language websites
- Explore a community-collaborative translation model

Through the efforts of the community, we hope to make some websites more friendly to Chinese users.

## ✨ Key Features

- **✏️ Manual Proofreading**: Translations are submitted and corrected by community members to improve accuracy and appropriateness.
- **🚀 Seamless Experience**: A built-in "anti-flicker" loading mechanism ensures page content remains stable before and after translation is applied, eliminating page shaking and flickering.
- **🌐 Smart Adaptation**: The script automatically detects the browser's language and applies the translation. You can also switch manually in the Tampermonkey menu.
- **🌍 Community Driven**: An open project that welcomes all users to contribute, jointly expanding and improving the translation library.
- **🔧 Terminal Tools**: Provides easy-to-use command-line tools for developers to check, build, and manage translation content.
