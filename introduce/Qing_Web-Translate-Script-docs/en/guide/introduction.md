# Introduction

## 🤔 What is this?

"Web Translate Script" is a browser enhancement tool that runs on top of user script managers like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

Unlike the browser's built-in "full-page translate" feature, all translations provided by this script are contributed by the community. We aim for "manual localization" that is precise and natural, rather than stiff machine translations.

Our goals are to:
- **Improve the browsing experience on frequently used websites.**
- **Reduce the reading strain on foreign language websites.**
- **Provide high-quality, trustworthy translated content.**

Through the power of the community, we hope to make more great websites more accessible to a wider audience.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎯 Accurate Translations**: All translations are manually written to ensure correct terminology and context.
- **🚀 Seamless Experience**: A built-in "anti-flicker" loading mechanism keeps the page content stable, eliminating flickering and layout shifts.
- **🌐 Smart Adaptation**: The script can automatically detect the browser's language and apply translations. You can also switch manually from the Tampermonkey menu.
- **🌍 Community Driven**: An open project that welcomes all users to contribute, helping to expand and improve the translation library.
- **🔧 Developer Tools**: Provides easy-to-use command-line tools for developers to check, build, and manage translation content.
