# Introduction

## 🤔 What is this?

"WEB Chinese Localization Script" is a browser script that runs on a user script manager like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

Different from the browser's built-in "Translate full page" feature, the translations in this script are contributed by community users. It aims to provide "manual localization" that is accurate and idiomatic, rather than rigid machine translation.

This project hopes to:
- Improve the browsing experience of some frequently used websites.
- Reduce the difficulty of reading foreign language websites.
- Explore a community-driven translation model.

Through the power of the community, we hope to make more quality websites more friendly to Chinese users.

## ✨ Main Features

- **✏️ Manual Proofreading**: Translations are submitted and revised by community members to improve accuracy and appropriateness.
- **🚀 Seamless Experience**: A built-in "anti-flicker" loading mechanism keeps the page content stable before and after the translation is applied, eliminating page jitter and flickering.
- **🌐 Smart Adaptation**: The script can automatically detect the browser language and apply the translation, or you can switch manually in the Tampermonkey menu.
- **🌍 Community Driven**: An open project that welcomes all users to contribute and jointly expand and improve the translation library.
- **🔧 Terminal Tools**: Provides easy-to-use command-line tools for developers to check, build, and manage translation content.
